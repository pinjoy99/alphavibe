### Project Rules

1. When given the command **"study"**, prioritize reading `README.md` and documents under the `doc/` directory first, then study code in `src/` and the project root.
2. Perform end-to-end testing after every modification.  
3. Update all relevant documentation with every change.  
4. Write clear and concise git commit messages (preferably under 5 lines).  
5. Push changes only after completing the above steps.  
6. 무언가를 설치를 할 때는 루트에 있는 requirements.txt 를 먼저 확인해하고, 가상환경에도 반영해줘.
